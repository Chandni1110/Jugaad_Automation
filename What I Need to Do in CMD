What I Need To DO In CMD

Summary of What You Need to Do in the Terminal:
Step 2: Create a project folder and open the terminal/command prompt.
Step 3: Run npm init -y to initialize the project (no need to open Node.js separately).
Step 4: Run npm install selenium-webdriver to install Selenium, and npm install chromedriver (or geckodriver for Firefox).
Step 5: Write your test script in Sublime Text.
Step 6: Use node test.js in the terminal to run the script.
You donâ€™t need to open Node.js for this. Everything is done from the terminal. Node.js is being used behind the scenes when you run npm commands or node test.js.

Let me know if you need further clarification!

===========================================================
How it works:

1. 	Developer pushes code to the repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
2.	The CI tool detects the code change and triggers the automated tests.
3.	The tests run (either locally on your machines or on cloud services like BrowserStack).
4. 	The CI tool collects results, and developers get feedback on whether their changes broke any functionality.
===============================================
Step 3: Set Up GitHub Actions
Create GitHub Actions directory: In your project, create a .github/workflows directory to store your workflow configuration:

bash
Copy
mkdir -p .github/workflows
Create a new GitHub Actions workflow YAML file: Inside .github/workflows, create a file named selenium-tests.yml:

bash
Copy
touch .github/workflows/selenium-tests.yml
Add the GitHub Actions workflow configuration: Open the selenium-tests.yml file and add the following content:

yaml
Copy
name: Run Selenium Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Trigger this action on pushing to the 'main' branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main  # Trigger on pull requests targeting the 'main' branch

jobs:
  selenium-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Use the latest Ubuntu runner from GitHub Actions

    steps:
      # Check out the repository code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Set up Node.js
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'  # Specify Node.js version to use

      # Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Run the Selenium tests
      - name: Run Selenium Tests
        run: node test.js
Commit and push the workflow to your GitHub repository:

Add, commit, and push the changes:
bash
Copy
git add .github/workflows/selenium-tests.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for Selenium tests"
git push origin main
